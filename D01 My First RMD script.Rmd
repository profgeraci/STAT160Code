## My first RMD SCript

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
require(mosaic)   # Load additional packages here 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
```

This is my first RMD file. Isn't this fun?

```{r}
54.3 + 67.1 + sqrt(67)

myname <- "Anne"
location <- "Rochester"


```
